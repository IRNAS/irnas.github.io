<p>All the experiments are performed in a <strong>50m corridor, 2m high and 1m wide</strong>, constructed using
clear PVC foil draped over rigid, wooden frame inside a dark hall. Tunnel can be entered trough
double opening in foil located on both sides and in the middle. <strong>Up to three FSO links</strong> can bi
set up parallel along the tunnel, each of them mounted on a railing, fixed in the concrete block,
eliminating misalignment due to unstable mounting.</p>

<p>To simulate fog conditions fog is produced using the fog machine and uniformly distributed down
the corridor using adequate ventilation. So far experiments indicate that using the fog machine
results in realistic fog conditions, however dry ice and a signal 
flares are planned for use in the near
future as well. Further systems, such as heating chambers, vibration measuring system and scintillation simulation experiment are currently under the development and should be installed in the facility

                        For terrestrial FSO systems, primarily located in urban areas offering mid-range connections, the leading cause of attenuation is presence of aerosols such as fog, smoke or dust in the
                        atmosphere, due to scattering and absorption of the optical beam. Fog is composed of dispersed
                        water droplets, generally between 10-15 microns in diameter, which is close to the near IR spectrum,
                        thus Mie scattering, which appears when particles present in the atmosphere and the wavelength
                        are comparable in size is present. In an indoor experiment, closely mimicking ambient conditions in the case of fog, smoke or
                        both, outdoor conditions are simulated in a controlled manner, using fog machine, dry ice and a
                        signal  are. Controlled conditions allow performance of reliable measurements, otherwise often not
                        possible due to irregularity and inhomogeneous distribution of the natural fog.

                        Uneven exposure to the Sun and sudden or gradual variation of the
                        temperature of either surrounding atmosphere, mount or enclosure can lead to gradual degradation
                        of the link or even complete loss due to physical deformation of components and consequential
                        misalignment.
                        Depending on the material used, daily and seasonal temperature variations can result in thermal
                        expansion which causes periodical misalignment of the link. Data analysis of current link deployments suggest strong correlation between day-to-night temperature variation and link availability,
                        however exact cause of link degradation remains unknown. Artifcial variation of the temperature
                        of the unit itself or just the surrounding air can help to determine the extent to which the link is
                        affected and find potential cause of impairment.

                        Another phenomenon potentially contributing to link loss is scintillation - optical
                        turbulence resulting from small temperature variations along the link path. Inhomogeneous temperature distribution of the atmosphere causes varying refractive index along the link and thus
                        scattering of the beam at different angles. Consequentially 
                        fluctuations in received power due to
                        redistribution of intensity within the beam may appear. Although the research indicates scintillation is not a mayor concern for optical links shorter than 500m, variance of the optical power
                        can be compared for the monitored link inside test facility and outside link of same length, as the
                        scintillation in closed dark space should be minimal.

                        degradation of the signal. In contrast to changes in the atmosphere, loss is contributed to the
                        temporal or prolonged misalignment of two units and not scattering of the beam. As units are
                        usually mounted on a building, either rooftop or wall, building vibrations can have significant
                        impact on the link performance, specially in urban environment due to motorways, public transport

                        system, an alternative beam scanner system was designed, suitable for producing a 2D scan of
                        emitted optical power at a fixed distance from the source. Multiple 2D scans, taken at varies
                        distances from the optical source are used to create a volumetric model of power distribution of an
                        optical beam.</p>

                        various system components is challenging or even impossible task, due to constantly changing
                        environmental and other external variables. In test facility external changes are minimised and
                        closely monitored using build-in test units, collecting data at the rate of 10Hz, allowing isolation
                        and objective assessment of a single variable.</p>

                        <h4>Fog</h4>
                        <p>For terrestrial FSO systems, primarily located in urban areas offering mid-range connec-
                        tions, the leading cause of attenuation is presence of aerosols such as fog, smoke or dust in the
                        atmosphere, due to scattering and absorption of the optical beam. Fog is composed of dispersed
                        water droplets, generally between 10-15 microns in diameter, which is close to the near IR spectrum,
                        thus Mie scattering, which appears when particles present in the atmosphere and the wavelength
                        are comparable in size is present. In an indoor experiment, closely mimicking ambient conditions in the case of fog, smoke or
                        both, outdoor conditions are simulated in a controlled manner, using fog machine, dry ice and a
                        signal  are. Controlled conditions allow performance of reliable measurements, otherwise often not
                        possible due to irregularity and inhomogeneous distribution of the natural fog.</p>

                        <h4>Temperature variation</h4>
                        <p>Uneven exposure to the Sun and sudden or gradual variation of the
                        temperature of either surrounding atmosphere, mount or enclosure can lead to gradual degradation
                        of the link or even complete loss due to physical deformation of components and consequential
                        misalignment.
                        Depending on the material used, daily and seasonal temperature variations can result in thermal
                        expansion which causes periodical misalignment of the link. Data analysis of current link deploy-
                        ments suggest strong correlation between day-to-night temperature variation and link availability,
                        however exact cause of link degradation remains unknown. Artifcial variation of the temperature
                        of the unit itself or just the surrounding air can help to determine the extent to which the link is
                        affected and find potential cause of impairment.</p>

                        <h4>Scintillation</h4>
                        <p>Another phenomenon potentially contributing to link loss is scintillation - optical
                        turbulence resulting from small temperature variations along the link path. Inhomogeneous tem-
                        perature distribution of the atmosphere causes varying refractive index along the link and thus
                        scattering of the beam at different angles. Consequentially 
                        uctuations in received power due to
                        redistribution of intensity within the beam may appear. Although the research indicates scintil-
                        lation is not a mayor concern for optical links shorter than 500m, variance of the optical power
                        can be compared for the monitored link inside test facility and outside link of same length, as the
                        scintillation in closed dark space should be minimal.</p>

                        <h4>Background light</h4>
                        <p>High level of background light, such as on a very sunny day or at the direct
                        exposure of the receiver to the sunlight at sunrise and sunset, can alter the reliability of receiver
                        readings due to high noise levels. Effect is hard to detect and often attributed to other factors, as
                        it usually coincide with the temperature variation.
                        Similar situation can be replicated by pointing strong white light source into the other unit at
                        different angles while closely monitoring sensor readings.</p>

                        <h4>Vibrations</h4>
                        <p>Besides unavoidable severe weather conditions and physical obstacles on the link,
                        the mounting environment is one of the leading factors contributing to misalignment and potential
                        degradation of the signal. In contrast to changes in the atmosphere, loss is contributed to the
                        temporal or prolonged misalignment of two units and not scattering of the beam. As units are
                        usually mounted on a building, either rooftop or wall, building vibrations can have signicant
                        impact on the link performance, specially in urban environment due to motorways, public transport
                        such as under and overground railways, construction work and also mechanical equipment present
                        in the building itself.
                        Another problem may arise due to wind induced movement of buildings, railings and unit itself,
                        potentially problematic in mounting on tall structures.</p>
