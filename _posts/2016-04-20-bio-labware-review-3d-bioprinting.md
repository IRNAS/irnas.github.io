This week we will look into [3D printing - bio style](https://github.com/symbiolab/bio-labware/blob/master/090_3d_bioprint.md){:target="_blank"}! With its wide applicability in rapid prototyping, affordability (of some good enough devices) and relative simplicity in its use, the fast development of 3D printing is promoted not only by the industry but also by hobbyists, scientists and other members of the civil society. In recent years a branch of 3D printing is being developed, which will be especially interesting for prosthetics and other biomedical uses - 3D BIOprinting!

This technology combines conventional 3D printing methods with living cell – and tissue cultivation. Potentially, this allows the reconstruction of various body parts in precise forms and even using cells of the affected patient, maximizing tissue compatibility. In addition, 3D bioprinting is a very promising technology for science and especially research on tissue engineering, as it allows precise control of cell arrangement and cultivation media, vastly important studying cell behaviour.

For more info on bioprinting and its current DIY status, check out our [new Github post](https://github.com/symbiolab/bio-labware/blob/master/090_3d_bioprint.md){:target="_blank"}, this week kindly provided by Biomedical Engineer Luka Banović. Be amazed by this new and exciting technology!
