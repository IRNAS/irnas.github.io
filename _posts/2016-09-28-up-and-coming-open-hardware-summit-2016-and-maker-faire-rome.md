There are two big events coming up in October. On 7th October Luka is travelling to Portland, where an annual [Open Hardware Summit](http://2016.oshwa.org/){:target="_blank"} is happening. An event, which brings together professionals, artists and enhusiasts from open hardware community, organized by [The Open Source Hardware Association](http://www.oshwa.org/){:target="_blank"}, an organization that aims to be the voice of the OH community, ensuring that technological knowledge is accessible to everyone, and encouraging the collaborative development of technology that serves education, environmental sustainability, and human welfare. On this occasion Luka is going to talk about open and good enough manufacturing solutions we developed, which are transforming the way we make stuff.

From 14th to 16th October we'll be in Rome participating at the [Maker Faire European edition](http://www.makerfairerome.eu/en/){:target="_blank"}, where we'll together with makers from all around the world showcase our creations and share learnings, celebrating the maker movement. We'll present and demonstrate [Koruza](http://explore.makerfairerome.eu/poi/Exhibit_1299){:target="_blank"} and [GoodEnoughCNC](http://explore.makerfairerome.eu/poi/Exhibit_1306){:target="_blank"} as well as hold [a workshop](http://explore.makerfairerome.eu/evento/Event_105){:target="_blank"} of building [Hybrid CNC](http://goodenoughcnc.eu/hybrid-cnc/){:target="_blank"} on Friday, 14th October 2016, from 3 pm to 7 pm and sharing how [GoodEnoughCNC](http://goodenoughcnc.eu/){:target="_blank"} can be used for good in [a talk](http://explore.makerfairerome.eu/evento/Event_104){:target="_blank"} on Sunday, 16th October, at 12 pm.
