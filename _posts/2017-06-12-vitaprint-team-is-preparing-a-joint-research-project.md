In the beginning of June, we were paid a visit by our friends from the [Institute of Biomedical Mechatronics in Linz](http://www.jku.at/mmt/content){:target="_blank"}. In preparation of a joint research project, we set out to implement our [Vitaprint](http://irnas.eu/vitaprint){:target="_blank"} with a small laser engraver and test whether extrusion bioprinting could be used and controlled simultaneously with the laser, using our hardware. Using both technologies at once, has potentially enormous implications for digital fabrication, especially in the biomedical sector, as it could allow manufacturing of new materials with advanced geometrical and structural complexities.

After a long day of adjusting and testing, we were able to successfully engrave plastics, but also create gelatin microfluidics with surface channels and even write paths approximately a millimeter beneath. A few snapshots of our collaborative work can be seen below.

With the successful integration of extrusion bioprinting and laser cutting/engraving, we will strive towards further development of the technology with the hope to push the current limits of resolution, materials and fabrication protocols.
