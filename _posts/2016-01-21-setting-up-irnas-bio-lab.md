Institute IRNAS is expanding! We are widening our research in the areas of biological and biomedical science by setting up new facilities with an open/DIY biolaboratory. Bo≈°tjan, who is joining our team in February, is going to work full time to make Bio lab a reality.

We will use existing low cost and DIY tools to create a functional laboratory and fill the existing gaps in low cost equipment by adding new tools to the open bioware repository and optimizing it for research purposes. All our documentation on how to start a bio lab of this kind will be freely available online. 

Our new lab will be used for high-end research in the fields we believe will shape our future, such as urban farming, biomaterials combined with 3D printing and nanotechnology, sustainable development, etc.

Once the Lab is up and running, we will also offer lectures, discussions and workshops for those interested in life sciences, and provide help and opportunity to those, who wish to start their own projects.
