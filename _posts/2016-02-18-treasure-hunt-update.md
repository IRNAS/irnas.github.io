**A massive thank you to our first donators!**

We have just obtained our first labware donation for [symbiolab](http://irnas.eu/symbiolab){:target="_blank"} - the open biolaboratory, kindly provided by [Sanolabor d.d.](https://www.sanolabor.si/){:target="_blank"}.

The package contains a magnetic stirrer, glass pipettes, slides, filters, glass adapters, nitrile gloves,... This brings us one step closer to get the lab up and running.

We would also like to thank Valentis medical d.o.o. for providing office supplies and latex gloves.
