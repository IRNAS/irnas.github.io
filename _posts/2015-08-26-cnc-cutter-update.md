The past week we have focused on finalizing the [GoodenoughCNC Plasma cutter]({{ site.url }}/2015/06/11/good-eough-cnc-cutting/), thus working towards the release. After extensive testing and evaluation of several options we optimized Z axis dimensions and reduced the number of assembly parts. Z stage in particular has been an interesting challenge for which we have designed 3 different solutions, each with particular benefit. Mounting of the three solutions has now been unified with mounting hinges, enabling simple servicing of the cutting torch as well as swapping the whole Z stage in the go, particularly suitable for multi-function machines.

Latest updates to GoodenoughCNC Plasma V2 include the following enhancements:

- reduced number of 3D printed parts to only 4 different pieces,
- improved connection of X axis to trolleys,
- 3 different solutions for Z axis
- tested assembly with stainless steel and standard profiles

In the construction of this version, which also serves as a basis for writing the instructions for assembly, we decided to use the third version of the Z axis as the primary. Its advantage is very cheap and quick production while enabling 200mm vertical movement. The base for design are mounted guides for drawers, widely available in hardware stores. It contains only three 3D printed parts which may also be replaced by simple wooden versions if 3D printing is unavailable.

The ongoing effort of creating full technical documentation with necessary instructions is progressing well and shortly the system will be release ready.
