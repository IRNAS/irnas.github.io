**We have some more good news!**

**GoodEnoughCNC hybrid will be for sale after the workshop.** Everyone interested please get in contact via [email](mailto:info@irnas.eu){:target="_blank"} or find us at the event IN(3D)USTRY in [Maker Pro section](http://makerpro.fab.city/exhibition/){:target="_blank"}. The price of the assembled machine including [Planet CNC](http://planet-cnc.com/){:target="_blank"} control system and milling machine - 0.8 KV spindle + inverter is 1560,00 EUR. The dimensions of the machine are 1100 mm  x 1600 mm with cutting area 800 mm x 1300 mm. If you’re worried about the size and transportation, this isn’t a problem at all.  The machine can be disassembled in only one hour and you shouldn’t need more than this to put it back together.
