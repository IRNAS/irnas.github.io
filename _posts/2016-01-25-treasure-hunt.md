The first hurdle on our way to awesome open-source bioscience is getting [symbiolab](http://irnas.eu/symbiolab.html){:target="_blank"}, open bio lab up and running. We will be pursuing this goal over the course of this year in 3 stages.

First, we will reorganize our new facilities and equip them with basic furniture and â€œkitchenware". This will be followed by installing the basic equipment for sample preparation and general biochemical analysis. Finally, we will be establishing an ambient controlled lab for growth experiments with aseptic working capabilities.

A list of to-be acquired equipment can be found [here](https://www.checkli.com/s/HKTxe0kp){:target="_blank"}. If you would like to contribute to our cause, you can help by sharing or donating (please, no broken equipment). Your assistance will be greatly appreciated.
