[First KORUZA workshop for scientific applications](http://koruza.net/events/){:target="_blank"} is behind us. Weâ€™ve spent a week with three participants from around the world at our Institute, here in Slovenia, educating them on the detailed operation of wireless optical system [Koruza](http://koruza.net/){:target="_blank"}.

Luka guided them though step-by-step assembly of the system, calibration and testing. We've finished the workshop with testing of the system in the 50m long testing tunnel. We improvised a bit since the tunnel is currently under construction. It will be fully equipped for FSO testing in the next months. However, we managed to simulate the conditions of fog, so the participants were able to see how the links behave under different ambient conditions.

Empowered with knowledge and experience participants will be able to use [Koruza](http://koruza.net/){:target="_blank"} assembly kits to construct and calibrate more units independently as well as design modification for scientific applications.

Participants come from the countries with very different climate and weather conditions (ex. sandstorms), that is why it will be very interesting to follow the performance of Koruzas under such conditions. 

Again, we would like to thank all the participants for attending this workshop.

[Next KORUZA workshop](http://koruza.net/events/){:target="_blank"} for scientific applications will be held in Fabruary 2016. Stay tuned for the details!
