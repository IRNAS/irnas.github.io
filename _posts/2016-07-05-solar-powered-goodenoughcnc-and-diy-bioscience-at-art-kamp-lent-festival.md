For this year's edition of [Art kamp](http://www.festival-lent.si/program/prizorisce/calendar/location/tx_cal_location/Art_kamp_Mestni_park/){:target="_blank"} at [Lent Festival](http://www.festival-lent.si){:target="_blank"} here in Maribor we prepared many interesting projects and activities.

We have extended [GoodenoughCNC](http://goodenoughcnc.eu/){:target="_blank"} machines to operate on solar power for off-grid applications and sustainable manufacturing. With a selectable power supply setup [Troublemaker V2 3D printer](http://goodenoughcnc.eu/troublemaker-3d/){:target="_blank"} and [Hybrid CNC machine](http://goodenoughcnc.eu/hybrid-cnc/){:target="_blank"} with mill or laser tool-head can operate in any sunny location. By using off-the-shelf solar panels, car batteries and some smart electronics, we have deployed the machines at Festival Lent in the city park of Maribor for the weekend and manufactured some cool open hardware projects.

Solar powering of these machines can have a significant benefit for a number of new application, ranging from moving digital manufacturing close to the source and thus minimizing transport costs, to enabling activities in locations with intermittent or no power as well as in mobile settings. To share the knowledge about our machines and their off-grid use, you are most invited to join our [GoodEnoughCNC Academy](http://goodenoughcnc.eu/academy/){:target="_blank"} program.

[Kreatorlab](http://www.kreatorlab.si/){:target="_blank"}, open fablab and our [symbiolab](http://irnas.eu/symbiolab){:target="_blank"}, open bio lab joined forces preparing interesting activities for children. We were making [spectrometers](https://publiclab.org/wiki/foldable-spec){:target="_blank"}, exploring light, doing some DIY microscopy, examining euglenas under our [diy microscope](http://hackteria.org/wiki/index.php/DIY_microscopy){:target="_blank"} and tried our 3d printed [stethoscope](https://github.com/GliaX/Stethoscope){:target="_blank"} and DIY [pulse sensor](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20522903){:target="_blank"}. 
In Kreatorlab workshop they were making cardboard 3D puzzles and playing board games, which were 3D printed and laser cut in Kreatorlab fablab.

Weekend was lots of fun and we invite everyone interested in DIY making and science to come visit us again in our open biolab [symbiolab](http://irnas.eu/symbiolab){:target="_blank"} and fablab [Kreatorlab](http://www.kreatorlab.si/){:target="_blank"} or join one of the upcoming workshops. Our door is always open!
