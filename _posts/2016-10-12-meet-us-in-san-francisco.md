At the end of this month [Luka](https://twitter.com/slomusti){:target="_blank"} is visiting San Francisco. We invite all open source, open hardware enthusiasts to join us for the public event at [The San Francisco Nonprofit Technology Center](http://sftechcenter.org/koruza-project-visits-san-francisco/){:target="_blank"}, operated by [Aspiration](https://aspirationtech.org){:target="_blank"} on Monday, 24 October, at 4pm, where [Luka](https://twitter.com/slomusti){:target="_blank"} is going to explain and demonstrate [Koruza](http://new.koruza.net/){:target="_blank"} optical networking technology, the first open source wireless optical communication system for urban environments as well as tell you more about our open and affordable tools for digital manufacturing [GoodEnoughCNC](http://goodenoughcnc.eu/){:target="_blank"} , which are good enough for general use.

Please, be so kind and let us know if you’re joining us by sending a short e-mail with subject "SF RSVP", stating your name and the organization/company you're from to the address [events@koruza.net](events@koruza.net){:target="_top"}.

From 25th to 27th October Luka is also participating at [Meetig of the Minds 2016](http://cityminded.org/events/motm2016){:target="_blank"} annual summit, which brings together 400+ opinion-shapers, policy-makers, leading thinkers and innovators from 25+ countries for two and half days of intensive exchange in thought leadership and cross-sector alliance building. Gathered together, they will have unique opportunities to think critically, ask questions, share tools, identify new best practices, and build lasting partnerships — which make smarter and more sustainable cities possible. 

See you in SF!
