4YFN, the growing tech startup community, is the business platform of Mobile World Capital Barcelona and this year’s event, the fourth in a row as part of the [Mobile World Congress](https://www.mobileworldcongress.com/events/4yfn/){:target="_blank"}, will be held in Spain’s beautiful art and architecture capital from 27th February till 1st March.

Connecting startups, investors and corporations from all around the World in order to enable new ventures, is the main focus of 4YFN. More than 500 new startups are expected to be exhibiting at the “Innovation Market”, a special place where innovations are shown and new partnerships are formed. Workshop areas provide valuable counselling from mentoring experts.

This year, three stages will host speakers from Netflix, Microsoft (and other) Ventures, Intel, PayPal, Alibaba, Facebook, Nokia and a variety of other companies, who will be addressing the evolving young companies with inspiring talks, introducing trends and visions in the digital realm, as well as giving precious tips on how startups can become successful companies and organizations.

Three days will offer three main themes, each with 4 groups of subtopics: Monday 27th February is opening with “Disrupted by Mobile”, Tuesday 28th February will be all about the “Internet of Things (IoT)”, and Wednesday 1st March will bring topics about “Digital Media”.

A fast growing event, gaining more than 10.000 attendees from it’s first occurrence with 2.300 visitors 3 years ago, is a great opportunity to show [KORUZA](http://koruza.net/){:target="_blank"} wireless optical communication system has a big potential to be around more than four years from now. Let it be the Internet of Things or any Digital and Mobile topics, KORUZA fits them all, since nowadays practically every app needs an Internet connection. 1 Gbps or 10 Gbps version - KORUZA provides ultra-fast data transfer at the most affordable rates, empowering the digital world and the universe of apps with the ever-essential fuel: Internet.

Look for stand number D3.6, just opposite the Deutsche Telekom Hub.

¡Nos vemos en Barcelona!
