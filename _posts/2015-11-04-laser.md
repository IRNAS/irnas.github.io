{% include JB/setup %}

We started with development of GoodEnoughCNC Laser, which will basically be modification of our almost built prototype, GoodEnoughCNC Mill, which is in final stages of built. Whole construction is planned in a manner that the x-axis is easily exchangeable with x-axis used for Mill and x-axis used for laser. The rest of construction will stay the same. Such construction will produce two very useful CNC machines in one, with very straightforward to do re-installation procedure. 

Currently we are using 40 Watts CO2 laser tube which will be easily upgradable to 100 W and more. The current price goal for the complete laser machine, including all needed parts is less then 3000 EUR. Working area will stay the same, an impressive 1800mm X 2500mm. Pictures of 3D model GoodEnoughCNC Laser are coming soon!
