We develop for today’s needs while having in mind the tomorrow by making all our hardware solutions future-proof. But what exactly do we mean by this?

**Future-proof hardware ensures effective ownership and long term  serviceability.** Meaning, our users have total insight into the technology and complete  control over the devices, allowing for full use and repair. Users are also  empowered to innovate, explore and upgrade outside the original specification. The  lifespan of devices is consequently substantially extended and their reuse  encouraged.

**Future-proof is most practically and effectively reached by making the hardware designs and documentation open source.** But we go a step further. We truly think  about the future throughout the development process – for example we strive to design  our systems modularly and often use commonly available components to allow for  almost straightforward modifications and upgrades.

Currently, we are working on several future-proof projects - our [KORUZA Pro](http://www.koruza.net/){:target="_blank"} wireless optical communication system, [Vitaprint](http://irnas.eu/vitaprint){:target="_blank"} 3D bioprinting, [Pulse Oximeter](http://irnas.eu/other%20projects/2017/09/14/development-of-the-finger-clamp-for-glia-pulse-oximeter){:target="_blank"} in collaboration with  Tarek Loubani and his Glia project and [Pitstop turtle tags](http://irnas.eu/other%20projects/2017/07/27/testing-of-the-pitstop-turtle-tag-enclosures){:target="_blank"} together with  Alasdair Davies and his Arribada Initiative, to mention just some of them.

Want to find out more about our future-proof approach? All our team is  attending this year’s edition of [Mozfest](https://mozillafestival.org/){:target="_blank"} in London this week, between 27th and  29th October, therefore we invite you to [get in contact](mailto:info@irnas.eu){:target="_blank"} or simply find us  there. We are looking forward to discuss the future-proof concept with you and build new future-proof collaborations!
