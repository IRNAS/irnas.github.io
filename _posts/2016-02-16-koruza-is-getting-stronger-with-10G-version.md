[KORUZA 1.0 10G](http://koruza.net/specs/){:target="_blank"} is the latest achievement in our open source open hardware design effort to build a low-cost wireless networking technology for construction of building-to-building networks at 100m range in urban environments. The increase in link capacity from 1 Gbps to 10 Gbps is most welcome for internet service providers and other more demanding applications with significant traffic. Pre-orders for [DIY kits and pre-assembled version](http://fabrikor.eu/Koruza){:target="_blank"} are available with our partner company [Fabrikor](http://fabrikor.eu/Koruza){:target="_blank"}.

The development of 10 Gbps system has required significant changes in the electronics design as the original 1Gbps version employs a combination of a SFP and media converter with a wired ethernet port, which is not available at greater speeds. We have re-designed the system to allow the use of SFP back-to-back connectivity, thus enabling the construction of 10 Gbps units with a SFP port at the back of the unit. This improvement not only enables higher throughput of the wireless optical system itself, but can also be back-ported to the original 1 Gbps that can support a fibre optic connection to the unit.

We are currently actively debugging and improving [assembly instructions](http://instructions.koruza.net/){:target="_blank"}  and [the control interface](https://github.com/IRNAS/koruza-pi){:target="_blank"} of the system, to improve the reliability and support additional user features.
