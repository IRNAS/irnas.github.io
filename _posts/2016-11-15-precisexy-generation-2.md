Last year we started developing a low cost platform for scientific applications, to enable scientists globally to simply automate research tasks, have computer controlled microscopes and use it in various other applications.  Our solution [PreciseXY](https://github.com/IRNAS/PreciseXY){:target="_blank"} is a 3 axis translation stage, based on [CoreXY project](http://www.corexy.com/){:target="_blank"}. 

Testing and using of the first version revealed a few weaknesses and some possible improvements. We have collaborated with [OpenPlant](https://openplant.org/){:target="_blank"} at Cambridge University to develop a generation 2 of the system to be even more precise, accurate, stable and versatile.

In the first version we used timing belt pulleys to guide the timing belt but that has proved to cause too much resistance when the belts are fully tightened. Thatâ€™s why we've replaced them with idler wheels with bearings to ensure smoother movements.

We also added one more carriage on each X-axis linear rail to improve stability and to prevent unwanted diagonal movements, even at higher feed rates. Y-axis base plate was also strengthened for added stability.

Z-axis enables modular usage and installation of various needed systems. In the new version we are using a system with linear guides and a threaded rod, similar to the one that we are using in our optical wireless system [KORUZA](http://koruza.net/){:target="_blank"} but many modifications and custom builds are possible to fit a wide range of applications.

Currently we are performing tests and working with different scientific teams to use it for their applications, to that we'll be able to prepare interesting use-cases. Once completed we will offer PreciseXY in kit version at [Fabrikor](http://fabrikor.eu/){:target="_blank"} as well as prepare a detailed tutorial for the assembly and use of the system.
