This week in our bio-labware review, we are talking about [DIY Electrophysiology](https://github.com/symbiolab/bio-labware/blob/master/080_electrophysiology.md){:target="_blank"}. A section of the broader science that is Physiology, with its diverse and often not standardized methods, Electrophysiology is possibly the most developed one. Perhaps this is due to its wide applicability in Neuroscience, which together with molecular Biology currently seems to dominate the Biosciences.

Electrophysiology is a general term for all methods, that are used for measuring electrical properties of cells, such as conductivity and the reaction and translation of electrical impulses. As their electrical properties are especially interesting, it is often associated with the measurement of neurons (nerve cells), their parts (such as ion channels) or larger neuronal systems. Electrophysiology more often than not takes place on animals or their (still functional) tissues. Such experimentation therefore always has to be considered from an ethical perspective, as already described in the chapter on [Cell culture](https://github.com/symbiolab/bio-labware/blob/master/070_cell_culture.md){:target="_blank"}. We will begin this weeks review by discussing some basics and simple set-ups, but will also delve into more complex measurement systems such as patch-clamps, electroencephalograms (EEGs) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Take a look at the [full article on Github](https://github.com/symbiolab/bio-labware/blob/master/080_electrophysiology.md){:target="_blank"} and return next week for more DIY Biology.
