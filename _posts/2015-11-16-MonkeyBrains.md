On [KORUZA California tour]({{ site.url }}/2015/11/03/koruza-bay-area-tour/) Luka met guys from [MonkeyBrains](https://www.monkeybrains.net/){:target="_blank"}, San Francisco based internet service provider, who found KORUZA project interesting and will deploy a couple of experimental links in their networks. We are looking forward to their feedback on performance of KORUZA.

We are very thankful for their donation of professional free space optics links LightPointe from 2003. Luka already disassembled them and took out the interesting parts – some lens of great quality and collimators – which we will use to test on [KORUZA](http://koruza.net/){:target="_blank"} units.
