In the beginning of this year we developed and prototyped [an open source, reusable version of turtle tag enclosure, named Pitstop 1](http://irnas.eu/other%20projects/2016/01/14/turtle-tag-enclosure){:target="_blank"} for our friends at [Zoological society of London](https://www.zsl.org/){:target="_blank"}. We've also produced a small testing series of 12 enclosures, which already went through testing in real life scenarios.

For a starter, experts from [Zoological society of London](https://www.zsl.org/){:target="_blank"} tried it out taking it for a ride and splashing it in a few big waves on the island Principe. First results were positive, no leaking or other problems.

Afterwards, three Pitstops went through depth testing and passed it. They came back from the 50m deep dry and alive.

Next step was deploying tags on the turtles. The results were successful. Apart one turtle tag, all others came back, after being 18 days in the sea, in good condition, with no water leakages or electronics damages. 

One tag didn't make it due to pressure related water damage. Even though all tags passed 50 m test, turtles can go down up to 300m, which might be beyond this turtle tag enclosure limit.

A next thing to do to would be building the pressure test chamber to get a better understanding of turtle tag characteristics and its limitations and work on improved version of this Pitstop.

But for now, the story continues with a green sea turtle 0012, which decided it was done nesting and headed off into the blue for 2 years(!) with our tag on. We hope for the best!
