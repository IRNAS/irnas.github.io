Last weekend we took our open hardware on a road trip. On Friday, we stopped in Zagreb's makerspace – [Radiona](http://radiona.org/){:target="_blank"}, which was founded to enhance the visibility of makers’ open source culture and self-sustainable production, as well as with an aim of connecting all possible fields of art, science and technology. We presented [GoodEnoughCNC](http://goodenoughcnc.eu/){:target="_blank"} and [Koruza](http://koruza.net/){:target="_blank"} to their community as well as we got a chance to find out about all the interesting projects they are working on. We hope we will be able to join forces and soon organize some workshops together. We would be happy to host them in our [Kreatorlab](http://www.kreatorlab.si/){:target="_blank"} with their [Synthomir workshop](http://radiona.org/synthomir/){:target="_blank"} and we can organize a GoodEnoughCNC workshop for their community members, where people will be able to build some machines themselves with help of our mentors.

On Saturday, we had a demo station at [Hackaday Belgrade 2016](https://hackaday.io/belgrade/){:target="_blank"}, where Luka also gave a lighting talk presenting [ToslinkCNC](http://goodenoughcnc.eu/machines/#toslink-cnc){:target="_blank"}, fiber optic CNC control system. We would like to thank the organizers for hosting us and congratulate them for an amazing event, where we had a chance to meet and talk with so many inspiring people and an opportunity to listen about a bunch of interesting projects. Among others, about the history of the internet in Serbia by [Dejan Ristanovic](http://www.dejanristanovic.com/){:target="_blank"}, an inspiring talk about the importance of making the maker movement more accessible and inclusive, for women and minorities, by [Phoenix Perry](http://phoenixperry.com/){:target="_blank"}, and a super exciting story about building laser light synths by [Seb Lee-Delisle](http://seb.ly/){:target="_blank"}.

On Sunday we visited Belgrade's fab lab [Polyhedra](http://www.polyhedra.co/fab-lab.aspx){:target="_blank"} where Borko, who is running the place, showed us around the workshop and told us a story of how it all started. It is exciting to hear how their community is growing every day and what amazing projects they are working on. We left our [GoodEnoughCNC plasma/mill](http://goodenoughcnc.eu/machines/#plasma){:target="_blank"} there, so that members of their community can try it out and play with it. We are looking forward to see for what projects they will use it and to hear their feedback.

We ended our three days trip with a presentation of our affordable systems in [labOS](http://hacklabos.org/){:target="_blank"} , hacklab and makerspace in Osijek. There were many  young tech enthusiast in the audience and it was very inspiring to see them playing with our [PreciseXY](http://goodenoughcnc.eu/machines/#precise-xy){:target="_blank"} and even writing some G-code. On 14th May 2016 labOS team is organizing [Mini maker faire Osijek](https://makerfaireosijek.com/){:target="_blank"}. If you are a maker and want to present your projects, you can still apply [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/11YV7u-kHU6Aa68SMNpzAEziExzzz3NxLTbTcuhQ9IAk/viewform?ts=56cf7807&edit_requested=true){:target="_blank"}.
