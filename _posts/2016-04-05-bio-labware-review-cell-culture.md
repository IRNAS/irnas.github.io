Biological research sooner or later leads to investigations on "living stuff". This can mean pure observation, but also experiments on organisms or their parts. With the development of molecular and synthetic Biology, this increasingly requires the use of cell and tissue cultivation, not only in terms of unicellular microorganisms such as bacteria, algae or yeasts, but also cell lines of larger organisms, especially animals and plants.

Experimentation (on animals) that can lead to pain or suffering, requires moral and ethical justification and should always be minimized or replaced if possible. Cell and tissue culture is an essential tool, not only to achieve this goal, but also to make experiments which would otherwise be impossible.

In [this week's blog](https://github.com/symbiolab/bio-labware/blob/master/070_cell_culture.md){:target="_blank"}, we discuss the tools suitable for cell culture and the available DIY equipment.
