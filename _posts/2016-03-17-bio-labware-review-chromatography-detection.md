Half-way through! The [Bio labware review](https://github.com/symbiolab/bio-labware/blob/master/000_bio-labware_overview.md){:target="_blank"} enters its second part...

Last week, we discussed [the methods for separating substances](https://github.com/symbiolab/bio-labware/blob/master/040_chromatography_sep.md){:target="_blank"}, so now it's time to look at the techniques, by which these substances can be detected. Sometimes they are already observable/identifiable (for example by color), which makes them relatively simple to process and analyze. More often than not this is, however, not the case.

Which is why a proper form of detection is required. Many techniques have been developed over the years and quite a few (especially mild-nondestructive procedures) are based on methods also used for other endeavors, especially spectroscopy. In circumstances where this is not possible, harsh or destructive methods are required for detection... All this and more is discussed in our [new Github post](https://github.com/symbiolab/bio-labware/blob/master/050_chromatography_det.md){:target="_blank"}, so be sure to check it out and tune in next week!
