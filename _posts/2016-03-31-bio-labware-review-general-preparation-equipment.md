Our [Biolabware review](https://github.com/symbiolab/bio-labware/blob/master/000_bio-labware_overview.md){:target="_blank"} has been here for a while now, thus, dents in the existing chapters have stacked up a bit. This is why this week, we are posting an update on our existing chapter about [general preparation methods](https://github.com/symbiolab/bio-labware/blob/master/010_general_preparation.md){:target="_blank"}, to which we are adding 5 new tools:

- [the rotation wheel, a.k.a. tube rotator](https://github.com/symbiolab/bio-labware/blob/master/010_general_preparation.md#rotation-wheel){:target="_blank"},
- [the laboratory (orbital) shaker](https://github.com/symbiolab/bio-labware/blob/master/010_general_preparation.md#shaker){:target="_blank"},
- [the heating plate, a.k.a. slide warmer](https://github.com/symbiolab/bio-labware/blob/master/010_general_preparation.md#heat-plate){:target="_blank"},
- [the dry block heater](https://github.com/symbiolab/bio-labware/blob/master/010_general_preparation.md#heat-block){:target="_blank"} and
- [the fume hood](https://github.com/symbiolab/bio-labware/blob/master/010_general_preparation.md#fume-hood){:target="_blank"}.

While these probably don't come to mind immediately when thinking about lab equipment, they are important preparation tools for many, especially molecular methods. Take a look at our updated chapter on [github](https://github.com/symbiolab/bio-labware/blob/master/010_general_preparation.md){:target="_blank"}, to learn more and be sure to return next week, when we will be delving into the tools for cell cultivation...
