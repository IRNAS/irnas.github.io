In the beginning of the week we were busy filming the first video, officially introducing KORUZA 1.0 to the scientific community as well as the general public. We envisioned this short video to introduce the system and free space optical communication in general, to the diverse group of possible clients; from the DIY enthusiast, employing new technology in their existing communication system, to the scientists and developers building on our work and providing valuable testing feedback and also to the actual internet provides finding use for the system in their communication network, again guiding us in future development.
