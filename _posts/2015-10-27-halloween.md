With the Halloween just around the corner, we at the institute IRNAS decided it was time to combine work with fun and set up spooky mood with some creepy decoration. Since none of us was particularly excited about pumpkin carving, we did what we know best; put our machinery to good use! 

As with all our projects, we made it sure 'average' and 'already seen' are not words to describe our creation.

And you must admit our new rattlesnake pet looks pretty scary, at least for the laser-cut wooden snake.
