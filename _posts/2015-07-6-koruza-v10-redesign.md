In the past years KORUZA has been iterated through a number of versions, each exploring significant updates or simplifications. With version 5 we have launched [World Wide KORUZA](https://dev.wlan-si.net/wiki/KORUZA/WorldWideExperiment) experiment and have in the last year observed performance of these units subjected to weather and all other disturbances. In preparation for open source releasing a fully operational version of the system we have begun a full re-design implementing a number of improvements while reducing the number of assembly parts increasing modularity.

Currently we are preparing the documentation for the open source release and the public announcement on [Wireless Battle of the Mesh V8](http://battlemesh.org/BattleMeshV8) conference, we are holding in Maribor, Slovenia between 3rd and 9th august.

The new version 1.0 of KORUZA has all the 3D printed parts designed in OpenSCAD environment, enabling straightforward modification for everyone as well as simplified modification to insure a perfect fit on variety of 3D printers. The fully modular mechanical design interconnected with stainless steel rods now enables modification for a variety of use cases.

Shortly we will be releasing the full system and make available KITs of all parts required to replicate it along with complete documentation. Currently we are inviting experienced hackers and makers to join our closed beta to verify the design.
