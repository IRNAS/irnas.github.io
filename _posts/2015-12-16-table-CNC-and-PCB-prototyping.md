We've made some modification to our table CNC mill, so it is suitable for high speed PCB prototyping. We've designed and built aluminum die which supports two PCB sizes: 60 x 60 mm and 45 x 60 mm. Aluminum die levels PCB plate and with help of clamps holds it in place. Blank PCB plates with same dimensions as pocket (60 x 60 mm and 45 x 60mm) are pre-prepared.

Because of the die, we simplified prototyping of two sided PCB boards: if the origin for milling is taken at the center of the PCB we can easily turn over for second side milling with no need to take or measure origin the second time. 

Once the aluminum die is leveled,  measured for parallelism and permanently fixed with fixing screws on the CNC table, we don't have the need for warp compensation programs, since plates are parallel in +-0,03mm tolerance.
