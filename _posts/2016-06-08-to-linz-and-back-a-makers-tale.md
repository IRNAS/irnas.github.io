title: "To Linz and back, a maker's tale..."
description: "A few weeks back, we received a message, that the Institute of Biology II in Aachen (Boštjan's old workplace) was clearing their facilities and that we could have some of the equipment if we wished and would come get it at the Institute of Biomedical Mechatronics in Linz (close partners in research). We combined this visit with a couple of other presentations and demos at Linz's hacker/maker spaces and Ars Electronica center."

A few weeks back, we received a message, that the [Institute of Biology II in Aachen](http://www.biologie.rwth-aachen.de/cms/Biologie/Fachgruppe/Institute-und-Lehrstuehle/~ptk/Institut-fuer-Biologie-II-Zoology-Tierph/){:target="_blank"} (Boštjan's old workplace) was clearing their facilities and that we could have some of the equipment if we wished and would come get it at the [Institute of Biomedical Mechatronics](http://www.jku.at/mmt/content){:target="_blank"} in Linz (close partners in research).

Thus on the 2nd and 3rd of June, we traveled to the city of Linz to pick up the stuff but also to meet the local making/hacking community. Our first stop was the [Ars Electronica center](http://www.aec.at/center/en/){:target="_blank"}, where we got a tour of the museum and discussed the possibilities of exhibiting and making workshops at the center or the [Ars Electronica festival](http://www.aec.at/festival/){:target="_blank"}, which could be a great opportunity for us.

In the evening we visited the [Developer Lab of Linz or DevLoL](https://devlol.org/){:target="_blank"}, where we were met by a lovely crowd from the hacker/maker community in Linz. While not larger than the space we have in Maribor, the size of the community was quite impressive as hardly everyone fit into the room during the presentation. Musti held a live demonstration of our devices, while Boštjan was giving an overview of the new biolab. They were also joined by our Luka Banović who is a student of Medical Engineering at the Linz University of applied Sciences. The presentation was a real success and especially the [GoodEnoughCNC](http://goodenoughcnc.eu/){:target="_blank"} series seemed to catch a lot of interest.

After a late check-in to the hotel we went straight to bed as Friday was going to be full of activities! at 8.30 a.m. we were already at the [Institute for Biomedical Mechatronics (Johannes Kepler University - JKU)](http://www.jku.at/mmt/content){:target="_blank"}, setting up our hardware for the next presentation. In the company of the Institute's staff (also counting sandfish and Berber skinks!) and the guests from the [Institute of Polymer Product Engineering](http://www.jku.at/ippe/content){:target="_blank"} (or IPPE, also JKU) we had a presentation in the by now used fashion. We got a look into the current research at the Institute, which in some areas could very much be combined with our own, such as high density material extrusion 3D printing of biomaterials which we are gradually developing at IRNAS.

The guys from IPPE also invited us to see their facilities, located in the very modern Science Park. A place that holds most research space for polymer and engineering science at the University. We discussed propositions for collaboration on different projects such as education through making in technology, tissue engineering and other cool things.

After lunch, we packed our stuff and all the [newly donated things](http://irnas.eu/bio%20lab%20symbiolab/2016/06/06/huge-donation-big-thank-you){:target="_blank"}, thanks again!!! (read more on our [previous blog](http://irnas.eu/bio%20lab%20symbiolab/2016/06/06/huge-donation-big-thank-you){:target="_blank"}) and were off for the afternoon meetings. A short visit at the Ars Electronica future lab (development space with pretty neat workspaces e.g. drone testing halls) and our final demo at the ['Offenes Technologielabor Linz'](http://otelolinz.at/){:target="_blank"} - a social place for tinkering enthusiasts rather than hardcore engineering, it was interesting to get fresh perspectives on the things we do.

All in all, we had a busy but great time in Linz and hope to visit again soon, perhaps with a [GoodEnoughCNC workshop](http://goodenoughcnc.eu/workshops/){:target="_blank"}.
