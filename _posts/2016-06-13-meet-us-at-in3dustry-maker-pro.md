**MAKE IT AS A PRO**

We’ll be exhibiting and presenting our open hardware projects, [Koruza](http://koruza.net/){:target="_blank"} and [GoodEnoughCNC](http://goodenoughcnc.eu/){:target="_blank"}, at [Maker Pro section](http://makerpro.fab.city/exhibition/maker-pro/){:target="_blank"}  and Luka will participate at [Make it as a Pro panel](http://makerpro.fab.city/conference/){:target="_blank"}, curated by [Wevolver](https://www.wevolver.com/home/){:target="_blank"} and Fab City Research Laboratory on Tuesday, 21st June, at 10am. This time we’re taking everything one step further preparing a hands on session - [GoodEnoughCNC workshop](http://makerpro.fab.city/workshops/){:target="_blank"}, where participants will learn how to assemble GoodEnoughCNC hybrid and get empowered to build such machines themselves. The workshop is scheduled for 22nd June, at 11am.

**ABOUT GOODENOUGHCNC WORKSHOP**

In the first part of the workshop participants will learn about the power of open hardware and find out more about developing of wireless optical system KORUZA, 3D printers and CNC machines in an interdisciplinary setting, which enables the flow of solutions across projects and thus making them event better. The second practical part of the workshop will be devoted to GoodEnoughCNC philosophy of simple and effective digital manufacturing tools. Participants will learn how to use standard components and locally available materials to make the machines and help to assemble GoodEnoughCNC Hybrid with a milling head. We will put the GoodenoughCNC Hybrid into action immediately, making urban gardening [AKER](https://aker.me/){:target="_blank"} designs with it. Everyone interested in participating, please register [here](http://fablab.fikket.com/event/goodenough-cnc-workshop){:target="_blank"}.
