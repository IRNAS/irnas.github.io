For the last couple of months, our symbiolab was hosting a high-school research project for the "Youth for the progress of Maribor (Mladi za napredek Maribora)" competition. Our guest student Gabriela was investigating wood-decay mushrooms and their potentially medicinally active compounds.

During the time she spent here, our young prodigy has sucessfully created pure mycelium cultures of 7 fungi species and determined the antibiotic and antioxidative effects of both wild and cultivted substrates. The experiments show promising results for at least 3 fungi types and not only for the fresh collected ones, but the mycelia as well.

The official results are expected to be published in spring, so be sure to stay tuned!
