We would like to express our sincere gratitude to the Institute of Biology II at [RWTH Aachen University](http://www.mscc.rwth-aachen.de/){:target="_blank"} and the Institute of Biomedical Mechatronics at [JKU Linz](http://www.jku.at/content){:target="_blank"} for providing a HUGE donation for our [symbiolab](http://irnas.eu/symbiolab){:target="_blank"}! We are now richer for a stereo microscope, two classical optical microscopes, as well as a ton of glassware and salts for buffers and dyes for tissue staining. Thank you, so, so much!
