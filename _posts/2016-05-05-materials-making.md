We would like to invite you for the event What can be discovered in the Material Library and whom can we meet in the MakeSpace? - A conversation with Elizabeth Corbin and Richard Gamester.

- Do materials have memory?

- How does a self-healing concrete look like?

- What can you find in the Materials Library?

- What is making community all about?

- and much more.

The Institute of [Making Materials Library](http://www.instituteofmaking.org.uk/materials-library){:target="_blank"}, which is a collection of some of the most wondrous materials on earth, gathered from sheds, labs, grottoes and repositories around the world for their ability to fire the imagination and advance conceptualisation. It is a resource, laboratory, studio, and playground for the curious and material minded to conduct hands-on research through truly interdisciplinary inquiry and innovation. First established in 2005, today the Collection remains at the heart of the Institute of Making alongside the Institute's MakeSpace workshop -a dynamic pairing that provides all makers with a creative home in which to innovate, contemplate and understand all aspects of materials and explore their relationship to making.

From self-healing concrete to shape memory alloys; join Curator, Liz Corbin, in exploring a few of her favorite items from the Collection.

The presentation will be followed by a conversation with both guests.

This event is organized in collaboration with [Kreator Lab](http://www.kreatorlab.si/){:target="_blank"}.
