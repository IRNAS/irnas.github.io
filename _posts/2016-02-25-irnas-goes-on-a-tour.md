We are very excited that Luka is among the participants of [GOSH!2016, Gathering for Open Science Hardware](http://openplant.org/oshwforscience/){:target="_blank"}, which is happening 2 - 5 March 2016 in CERN, Geneva. Active developers, users and thinkers in the open science hardware space and other experts will meet with the aim to learn and build together, scoping the potential of the open science hardware field. Additionally, they'll be planning their way to help build a coherent, self-organising community to raise its profile and drive change within institutions to increase uptake and opportunities.

On his way there, Luka will stop in Milan's makerspace [Wemake](http://wemake.cc/){:target="_blank"} and on his way back in [FabLab MÃ¼nchen](http://www.fablab-muenchen.de/){:target="_blank"} to meet the community and to present our affordable manufacturing and networking solutions: [GoodEnoughCNC](http://goodenoughcnc.eu/){:target="_blank"} machines and [KORUZA](http://koruza.net/){:target="_blank"} system. You can register for the event in Milan [here](https://www.eventbrite.it/e/biglietti-open-hardware-dalla-slovenia-con-koruza-e-goodenoughcnc-1-marzo-2016-22068205597){:target="_blank"} .

If you're somewhere close, you're kindly invited to join the [events](http://koruza.net/events/){:target="_blank"}, learn more about [KORUZA](http://koruza.net/){:target="_blank"} - wireless 1Gbps networking system and see some of our [GoodEnoughCNC](http://goodenoughcnc.eu/){:target="_blank"}  machines in action.
