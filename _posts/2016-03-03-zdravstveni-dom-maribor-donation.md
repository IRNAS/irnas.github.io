We've just obtained a UV-Vis spectrometer from the local community health center - [Zdravstveni dom dr. Adolfa Drolca, Maribor](http://www.zd-mb.si/){:target="_blank"}! The device has a spectral range of 325-900nm, with a wavelength accuracy of 2nm and a precision of 1nm and will be a great addition to our collection. The package also contained a membrane pump system, which allows the analysis of flowing liquid samples. This could allow the analysis of cromatographically separated samples, which we will hopefully be able to prepare later on.
