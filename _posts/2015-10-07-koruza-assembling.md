Last week we have been busy assembling first larger amount of the KORUZA 1.0 units. Since the first [announcement]({{ site.url }}/2015/08/05/koruza-1-0/) of the new KORUZA 1.0 version, launch of the official [web page](https://koruza.net) and its presentation at the [IWOW 2015 conference]({{ site.url }}/2015/09/12/attending-iwow2015/), the interest has grown rapidly. While many individuals, research institutions and small internet providers are interested in the DIY kits - to be released soon - some are more keen on testing the already assembled units, thus manufacturing of the units is in full swing.  

The first batch of links will primarily serve us to get the necessary feedback on the performance in various environmental and demographical conditions around the world. Some of the assembled units will be used to replace the old versions and thus bring the World-Wide-Koruza experiment up to date with the latest improvements of the system. Some new links will be established as well, providing us with even more versatile and reliable performance data.

Although the extension and update of the KORUZA network is the main focus of the current manufacturing, it is not the only the only benefit we will get. The repeated assembly of larger amount of units gave us valuable insight in possible difficulties, future KORUZA users could account during the assembly process. We adjusted instructions accordingly to make them even more illustrative and user friendly. That bring us one step closer to finalising the release of DIY kits, planned this November.
