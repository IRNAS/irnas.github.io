One of the door handles in [Kreator Lab](http://www.kreatorlab.si/){:target="_blank"} got broken. Instead of buying a new one, they’ve made one. Dušan designed it  and our [Troublemaker](http://irnas.eu/services.html){:target="_blank"} printed it out. Now it opens the door to the storage room, serving its function perfectly.

Last week, IRNAS team also spent quite some time in Kreator Lab. We were learning a new skill at [the welding workshop](http://irnas.eu/other%20projects/2016/01/15/welding-workshop/){:target="_blank"} and we were making the first series of [turtle tag enclosures](http://irnas.eu/other%20projects/2016/01/14/turtle-tag-enclosure/){:target="_blank"}. This project was a nice challenge for CNC-mill. It cut aluminium and demonstrated that it knows how to three-dimensionally cut Plexiglas. A final step was made on [the new laser cutter](http://irnas.eu/irnas/2016/01/01/new-machine-in-the-house/){:target="_blank"}, which engraved some text on the enclosures.
