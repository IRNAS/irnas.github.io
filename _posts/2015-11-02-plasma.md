The day has come! We finished construction of CNC Plasma – the first part of our GoodEnoughCNC family is published with detailed assembly instruction and bill of materials. After extensive testing we are happy to say that regarding cutting speeds and accuracy, we are able to compete with other professional mid range CNC plasmas currently on the market, with 5-10 times higher price. Of course quality of a cut depends on plasma cutting module used – we used low middle range for app. 1500 eur, which enables us perpendicular kerf with almost no dross on upper and bottom edge of cutting.

You can find GoodEnoughCNC Plasma published on its own [web-page](http://goodenoughcnc.eu/), also containing [source](http://goodenoughcnc.eu/source/ ) files.

But development doesn't stop here, since we are always on the look for better design ideas and improvements. This week we came up with significant change in structural design of Z axis.

We completely changed our touching probe for material on Z axis and reduced parts count for 18. Instead of linear guides (small) we used smooth rod encased in new torch holder. Rod is half a millimetre under the tip of plasma torch in switch On position, so we are not measuring Z dimension with tip of plasma torch any more. Because of that we minimized material bending during measurement of material height.
