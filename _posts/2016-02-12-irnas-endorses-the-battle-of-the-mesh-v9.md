The ["Wireless Battle of the Mesh"](http://battlemesh.org/){:target="_blank"} is an event that aims to bring together people from across the globe to test the performance of different routing protocols for ad-hoc networks, like Babel, B.A.T.M.A.N, BMX, OLSR, and 802.11s.

Many developers and community networkers will join the event to hack, test, discuss, explain and learn.

**If you are interested in dynamic routing protocols or wireless community networks you can't miss this event!**

The battlemesh is free of charge and open for all, every year we strive to keep participation costs low by [negotiating deals for accommodation and food](http://battlemesh.org/BattleMeshV9#Participant_Registration_and_Fee){:target="_blank"}.


This year the event will take place from **Sunday 1st to Saturday 7th of May 2016 in Porto, Portugal**. The event is locally organized by *[INESC TEC](http://www.inesctec.pt/){:target="_blank"}, Porto, Portugal**. INESC TEC stands for Institute for Systems and Computer Engineering, Technology and Science and is a private non-profit research & development institute located on the campus of the Faculty of Engineering of the University of Porto (Portugal).

IRNAS endorses and supports the Battle of the Mesh v9 because of the efforts made by its community to advance the field of wireless mesh networking and foster the development of grass-roots community networks.

We will support the event by presenting our [Koruza](http://koruza.net/){:target="_blank"} project and providing the experimental hardware for testing.

Many other communities endorse and support the Wireless Battle of The Mesh v9  and an up to date [list of the endorsers of the Battlemesh v9](http://battlemesh.org/BattleMeshV9/#Endorsements){:target="_blank"} can be found at the main [Battlemesh website](http://battlemesh.org/BattleMeshV9){:target="_blank"}.
