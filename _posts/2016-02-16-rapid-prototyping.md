Wireless optical system [KORUZA](http://koruza.net/){:target="_blank"} can be most easily demonstrated or calibrated when put on sufficiently stable mounting. So far we have used [a concrete tile](http://irnas.eu/koruza/2015/12/23/temporary-koruza-mounting){:target="_blank"} with a mounting bracket, which is very stable but significantly to heavy for shipping or demonstration purposes. Thus, we have developed a lighter and small-form factor version that can be easily shipped inside a box. The new design uses commonly available aluminium extruded profiles and some nuts and bolts from a hardware store.

**Rapid development and prototyping process** that we follow for most projects has been applied here:

**1) Mockup from parts on stock or scrap-box**  - This way we quickly evaluate through possible solutions and decide on the most promising one. The stand was prototyped with some metal brackets and pieces of the alu profile, shows the idea but was insufficiently rigid.

**2) Rapid prototype** -  Using the fastest possible method to build parts, even if their properties may not be ideal. Joining brackets have been designed in CAD since commonly available ones are not suitable. They have been laser-cut from plywood as this takes minimal time.

**3) Design refinement after short testing** - Confirming the design is suitable, minor corrections to brackets have been made and adjustments to best fit the material the finished version will be made off.

**4) Manufacturing process evaluation** - The design has been made such that it only uses flat pieces that only require to be cut to right dimensions and holes added. Most effective option is laser cutting and alternatively milling can be used. Two versions of brackets have been made, one laser-cut acrylic and the other milled aluminium, the latter more expensive in manufacturing time and material cost. Both options were tested and only alu was sufficiently sturdy.

**5) Open source release** - completed and tested design has been [published](https://github.com/IRNAS/KORUZA-testing/tree/master/portable_mount){:target="_blank"} and is available for making or ordering from our manufacturing partner company [Fabrikor](http://fabrikor.eu/Koruza?product_id=54){:target="_blank"}.
