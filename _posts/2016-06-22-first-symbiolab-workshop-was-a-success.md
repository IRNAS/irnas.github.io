Eight students and two mentors from OŠ Duplek (the primary school in Duplek) payed us a visit at [symbiolab](http://irnas.eu/symbiolab){:target="_blank"} last week to get a hands-on learning experience about optical microscopy. After a short introductory lecture about optics, the history and technology behind optical microscopy, we went ahead to make some of our own.

Lucky for us, a lot of effort was already invested in the development of cheap DIY microscopes by our friends at [Hackteria](http://hackteria.org/){:target="_blank"} which made the design fully documented and available online. With the help of all the available equipment in [Kreatorlab](http://www.kreatorlab.si/){:target="_blank"} we were very successful and in the end everyone managed to build his or her own device and already test it on some interesting samples.

This was the first of its kind workshop that was hosted at [IRNAS symbiolab](http://irnas.eu/symbiolab){:target="_blank"}, which we can now officially declare as running. Being a fantastic experience for us and hopefully for our participants as well, we are looking forward to the workshops to come.

You can meet us again already this weekend at [Artcamp](https://www.facebook.com/events/254120128291526/){:target="_blank"}, at Festival Lent, from Friday to Sunday, from 4pm to 8pm. We’ll be making spectroscopes and you'll also have the opportunity to test our DIY microscopes and [GoodEnoughCNC](http://goodenoughcnc.eu/){:target="_blank"} machines, which will be solar powered this time.
