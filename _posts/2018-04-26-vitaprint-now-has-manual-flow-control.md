When working with custom materials and a broad range of nozzles, adjusting extrusion during the printing process is crucial for fast settings optimization. With the new version of [PlanetCNC](https://planet-cnc.com/){:target="_blank"} and the work of our mathematical analyst and algorithm developer Eva, we have now upgraded the [Vitaprint](http://irnas.eu/vitaprint){:target="_blank"} 3D bioprinter also with this feature, allowing manually regulating extrusion flow during printing, thus significantly increasing the ergonomics and usability of the hardware. Currently, the feature is being tested at the [Institute of Biomedical Sciences in Maribor](){:target="_blank"}, using in-house developed material formulations.

This weekend you can meet us and our Vitaprint at an amazing fab community event [Fabelgrade](http://www.fabelgrade.io/){:target="_blank"} in Belgrade, Serbia. If you are around, search for [Bioprinting Corner](http://www.fabelgrade.io/workshops/){:target="_blank"} to test Vitaprint with this new feature!
