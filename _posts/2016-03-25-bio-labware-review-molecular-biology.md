To understand the intricate workings of life, many of its aspects need to be studied. With the acceleration of technical advances, our capabilities to look deeper and deeper into living organisms are improving as well. In the last century, this has given rise to a new approach to understanding life, which is now one of the corner stones of life sciences - molecular biology.

Its focus lies on the investigation of biological molecules, especially genes and proteins, their structure and its correlation with function and all possible interactions.

Various methods are used, that are even grouped in different subfields, such as proteomics, genetic research and biotechnology, there are, however, a few standard techniques that are probably used in every molecular biology lab. These include methods such as immunostaining, gel electrophoresis and blotting, cloning, polymerase chain reactions, etc. In our [new Github post](https://github.com/symbiolab/bio-labware/blob/master/060_molecular_biology.md){:target="_blank"} we discuss some of the basic tools for the mentioned techniques and the existing DIY counterparts. Many of the techniques are also used in combination with other tools and methods, which extends our insight into the world of molecules even further. Be sure to check out [the full post](https://github.com/symbiolab/bio-labware/blob/master/060_molecular_biology.md){:target="_blank"} and come back next week for more DIY science!
