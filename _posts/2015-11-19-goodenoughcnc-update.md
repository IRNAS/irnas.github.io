Our [GoodEnoughCNC](http://goodenoughcnc.eu/){:target="_blank"} family is getting bigger! Currently we finished with modeling of CNC laser axis prototype, which is compatible with current GoodEnoughCNC mill construction. The prototype axis is designed in a manner that we can easily exchange milling X-axis with laser axis. At the same time, we are also designing construction intended only for use of laser X-axis. To keep weight down we are using aluminum profiles in construction of laser axis.

Currently the testing will commence with 40w Laser CO2 tube. Movement is attained with timing belt, using NEMA 23 Stepper motor and linear round guides with our custom support parts. We can achieve a 40 mm movement of laser lens in Z-axis. The axis is designed to be safe: whole construction is covered with an easy to make and remove laser shield, which is open only in downward position.
