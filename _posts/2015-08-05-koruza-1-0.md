In the beginning of the [July]({{ site.url }}/2015/07/06/koruza-v10-redesign/) the whole KORUZA system has undergone some significant changes in the design as well as in the mechanical and electronical structure, resulting in the 
new version 1.0 of KORUZA. The fully modular design, based around the stainless steel rods, have already proven to be much more stable due to elimination of large 3D-printed parts and 
simplified modification possibilities to ensure a perfect fit.

The system was officially presented on the [Wireless Battle of the Mesh V8](http://battlemesh.org/BattleMeshV8) conference, we held in Maribor, Slovenia between 3rd and 9th of August. 
Simultaneously we also launched our new [web page](http://koruza.net/), presenting KORUZA to the wide audience; from researches and hackers to the telecommunication companies 
and interested individuals.
As expected the announcement was well received and raised a lot of interest for the DIY kits to be released shortly. 

Currently we are at the final stages of releasing the complete documentation, using the [DocuBricks system]({{ site.url }}/2015/07/26/open-plant-open-technology-week/), which is expected to be released later this year as well and also preparing 
kits containing all necessary parts to assemble a working link at a competitive price.
