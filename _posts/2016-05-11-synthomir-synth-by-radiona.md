Remember our [Balkan road trip](http://irnas.eu/irnas,%20koruza,%20goodenoughcnc/2016/04/13/on-a-trip-zagreb-beograd-osijek){:target="_blank"}? We came back home with a great present â€“ [Synthomir](http://radiona.org/synthomir/){:target="_blank"}, 8 bit DIY synth, in kit version, designed and developed by [Radiona, Zagreb Makerspace](http://radiona.org/){:target="_blank"}.

We couldn't wait to build it and now, we've finally found some time to share the final result also with you. It was lots of fun making it following their [instructions in 20 steps](http://radiona.org/synthomir/content.html){:target="_blank"} - from soldering the resistors, crystal and its capacitors to soldering female headers, potentiometer and the male headers on the bottom side of the board.

Now, we only need to learn how to properly play on it. Check what is this instrument capable of on Synthomir presentation and demo video. Simply awesome!
