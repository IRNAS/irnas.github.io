Our next generation device [KORUZA Pro](http://new.koruza.net/){:target="_blank"} will enable a versatile construction of last-mile networks to peopleâ€™s homes and thus deliver them a faster internet service. To best cover all the possible installation scenarios and provide user friendly installation process, we are exploring and innovating on the mounting system.

Mounting system needed to be smaller than mount on previous [KORUZA 1.0](http://koruza.net/about-koruza-1.0/){:target="_blank"}  to minimize offset of KORUZA unit from the mounting structure and thus improve mechanical stability as well as to be aesthetically pleasing. We have designed a mount for KORUZA to be blended into surroundings and does not significantly alter the architectural value of the buildings. Main KORUZA enclosure has a number of mounting slots that can be interfaced with various mounting brackets optimized for specific use-cases. We have opted to use a mounting base into which a round rod is attached, allowing the pivot during installation. This solution enable us to just slightly tighten screws and freely move KORUZA in all directions and when it's in desirable position, fully tighten screws to stop all movement.

Mounting system is composed out of five main structural parts:

- Two mounting brackets onto which comes attached mounting jaws
- Mounting jaws that are used for mounting KORUZA onto pipes and poles
- Pivot rod 
- Mounting base that is attached on

All parts excluding mounting jaws are made out of aluminium. We decided to use this material because it is easy to work with on CNC milling machines, which was good enough for prototypes and test versions. But we discovered the problem when making pivoting assemblies where both parts are made out of aluminium: when aluminium hinge have higher surface roughness at the point of the contact or if two surfaces have foreign objects between such as sand or metal particles, the hinge binds together and becomes unusable. We temporarily solved this problem with lubricating the hinge. For use on a massive scale aluminium hinges are still not suitable. For another production batch we will change material of pivot rod to stainless steal with high surface finish.

Another issue that was discovered when test mounting KORUZA's was the danger of it falling of mounting brackets when it's not tighten all the way when adjusting position of unit. The problem was solved by installing spring pin in mounting base which locks in U groove on pivot rod.
