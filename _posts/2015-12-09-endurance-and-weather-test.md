Nearly 6 months ago we put to the test one prototype link of [KORUZA 1.0](http://koruza.net/){:target="_blank"} in location Rače, Slovenia. Link was setup at the distance of 50m and had to overcome quite few critical weather conditions. It was mount through the summer and autumn, so there were high fluctuations of temperature through the day – in summer months more than + - 20 degrees Celsius. Despite of heavy rain, high temperature differences and almost sub zero temperatures the connection between link was unbroken.

We took apart both Koruzas to see condition of structural parts and electronics. We did not find any signs of water leaks or drainage, all components were rust-free, the amount of foreign micro objects and dust were minimal and mostly a result of an assembly.
