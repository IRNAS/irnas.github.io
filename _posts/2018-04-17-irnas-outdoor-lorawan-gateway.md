The growing number of sensors and connected devices with [LoraWAN](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/docs/lorawan/){:target="_blank"} technology enables anything from [sea turtle monitoring](http://irnas.eu/other%20projects/2018/04/05/animal-conservation-with-lorawan-turtles-fish-and-more){:target="_blank"} to [MCCI power consumption and optimization monitoring](https://store.mcci.com/collections/lorawan-iot-and-the-things-network){:target="_blank"} and a wide range of other applications. The core of LoraWAN open community established network [The Things Network](https://www.google.com/search?q=the+things+network&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&client=firefox-b-ab){:target="_blank"} are gateways connected to the internet, these can range from industrial-grade and expensive units for example by Kerlink, Multitech and other to cost effective systems built with [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/){:target="_blank"} embedded modules, [resin.io](https://resin.io/){:target="_blank"} management system and [RAK wireless RAK831 gateway](http://www.rakwireless.com/en/WisKeyOSH/RAK831){:target="_blank"} modules.

To boost the growth of cost-effective community established outdoor gateways we have designed **IRNAS outdoor LoraWAN gateway** that includes all components and an antenna element in a weather-proof enclosure. This way communities can easily deploy good quality gateways with minimal costs.

**IRNAS outdoor LoraWAN gateway joins great solutions into a unified gateway:**

- [RAK wireless RAK831 gateway module](http://www.rakwireless.com/en/WisKeyOSH/RAK831){:target="_blank"}

- [Raspberry Pi Zero W](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-zero-w/){:target="_blank"} embedded computer + SD card

- [RAK-Raspberry Pi shield by ch2i](https://github.com/hallard/RAK831-Zero){:target="_blank"} 

- USB-Ethernet adapter and Waterproof PoE injector

- DIY 5.5dB co-linear antenna designed by [Fabien Ferrero from UNICE in France](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhFy4-kForA){:target="_blank"}

- Polyethilene tubing for enclosure

- [3D printed part by IRNAS](https://github.com/IRNAS/ttn-irnas-gw){:target="_blank"} to mount everything together

The final product is a simple and a cost-effective gateway for about 250 EUR anyone can make and simply install outdoors. With this design we have achieved over 50 km coverage between Pohorje mountain and cities of Graz in Austria and Zagreb in Croatia.

The next step is to use [IRNAS Drone mapping](http://irnas.eu/iot-drone-mapping){:target="_blank"} for Lora coverage. A great method we have developed to determine the coverage of this gateway and check out all the devices we have designed for challenging environments that implement LoraWAN connectivity.
