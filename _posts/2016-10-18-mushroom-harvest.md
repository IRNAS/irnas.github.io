It has been known for a while now that Oyster mushrooms (*Pleurotus ostreatus*, *Pleurotus eryngii*, etc.) are so called saprotophs - meaning they grow on dead or decaying organic materials. As a result, they are easy to cultivate on various substrates such as grain berries or straw, but also coffe grounds. These are becoming more and more popular, as they are otherwise considered waste. Due to [our high coffe consumption](http://www.ecf-coffee.org/images/European_Coffee_Report_2013-14.pdf){:target="_blank"} (averaged 4.84kg/per capita in the EU, 2012) this is a great source material. We have tried to grow *P. ostreatus* on sterilized coffe grounds here as well and after about 6 weeks of mycellial growth in a 1l glass jar, followed by a week of mushroom growth, we have had our first small harvest.
