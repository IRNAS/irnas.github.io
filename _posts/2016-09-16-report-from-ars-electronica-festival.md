For the first time ever, we had the opportunity to present our work at this year's [Ars Electronica Festival](http://www.aec.at/news/en/){:target="_blank"}. Now already traditionally combining art and technology while posing ethical and philosophical questions about both, the state of the art, as well as the future of humanity, the title this year was: Radical atoms and the alchemists of our time. In the old post center - postcity, Musti and Boštjan presented [our take on the future of communication and open source development](http://www.aec.at/radicalatoms/en/artist-lab-institute-irnas/){:target="_blank"}, showing off an installation of [Koruza](http://koruza.net/){:target="_blank"} from the early prototypes to the new version 2.0, set up a mini CNC workshop and an ad-hoc biolab.

We had the opportunity to meet up with other makers from the area, such as our friends from [devlol](https://devlol.org/){:target="_blank"} and a great many other interesting people from all over the world. Among them were also artists from Slovenia, such as [Špela Petrič](http://www.spelapetric.org/){:target="_blank"} with her [Miserable Machines](http://www.aec.at/radicalatoms/en/miserable-machines-soot-o-mat/){:target="_blank"} or [Robertina Šebjanič](http://robertina.net/){:target="_blank"} and [Slavko Glamočanin](http://www.glamocanin.net/){:target="_blank"}, who received an honorary mention for their interactive art installation [Aurelia 1+Hz / proto viva sonification](http://prix2016.aec.at/prixwinner/21280/){:target="_blank"}.

In addition to being fun and a great opportunity for networking, we were also able to do some serious work. We were visited by colleagues from the [JKU](http://www.jku.at/content){:target="_blank"} in Linz, which built our [Troublemaker 2](http://goodenoughcnc.eu/troublemaker-3d/){:target="_blank"} at the venue, testing the new model and [documentation](https://goodenoughcnc-troublemaker-3d-printer.readme.io/docs){:target="_blank"} and we tested our currently being developed [3D bioprinter - Vitaprint](http://irnas.eu/bio-lab-symbiolab/2016/10/06/institute-irnas-enters-the-field-of-bioprinting){:target="_blank"} with new materials such as gluten.

In the video below, you can see a small fraction of the things we were able to capture during our stay in Linz. It was an inspiring event and our great pleasure to be there.
