**Our team wishes everyone an open and a very successful 2017!**

For us already the very beginning of the year has been full of changes. With our product [Koruza](http://koruza.net/){:target="_blank"} growing to the point of entering the professional market we had to make some strategic decisions in the last quarter of 2016. We came to the conclusion that in house manufacturing of the system is the right way to move forward, for which an investment into some new machine tools was required. At the same time also our team has expanded during the last year, which now counts eleven core team members and around three part time collaborators. A logical consequence of all this was a need for some bigger premises.

We found a great space just across the river (always in Maribor, Slovenia) of 350 m<sup>2</sup>, perfect for setting up a fabrication lab, a biolab as well as an office space. With the goal of starting a new year already in the new premises, our team has spent the last two weeks of December having fun building and painting and then finally also moving everything in.

That is how we have started the 2017 already in our bright new space, which still needs some organizing and cleaning to be totally set up, but we are not far from being fully operational.

Stay tuned for an invitation to an official opening party :) as well as some photos of a final look of our new space!

We would also like to take this occasion to thank [Tkalka](http://tkalka.si/){:target="_blank"}, Maribor’s coworking building and the fablab [Kreatorlab](http://www.kreatorlab.si/){:target="_blank"}, which were an amazing second home for almost two years and made the first steps of Institute IRNAS so much easier than they would have been otherwise.

We are already looking forward to what this year will bring and we invited you to keep following us on our blog as well as [Twitter](https://twitter.com/institute_irnas){:target="_blank"} and [FB](https://www.facebook.com/instituteirnas/){:target="_blank"}.
