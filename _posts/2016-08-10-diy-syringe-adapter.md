As part of our‭ ‬[bioprinting story](https://github.com/symbiolab/bio-labware/blob/master/090_3d_bioprint.md){:target="_blank"} we‭ ‬developed a simple [DIY‭ ‬syringe adapter](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1690299){:target="_blank"}.‭ ‬The purpose of the development was to make it available in small amounts, as [syringe adapters](http://www.dispensinglink.com/syringe-adapters.html){:target="_blank"} have a low market price only when bought in large batches and are not easy to get otherwise.‭

‬Following the fashion of modularity and DIY mentality we designed the first‭ ‬version of the functioning‭ ‬[DIY adapter](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1690299){:target="_blank"} for a‭ ‬5 mL syringe, but it can be easily rescaled for other sizes.‭ ‬Standard syringe sizes can be found in the Harvardapparatus Syringe Selection Guide.‭ ‬The design requires a‭ ‬3D printer,‭ ‬a‭ ‬5‭ ‬mL syringe,‭ ‬4‭ ‬screws,‭ ‬4‭ ‬nuts,‭ ‬3‭ ‬seal washers and a‭ ‬silicone tube (‬outer diameter‭ = ‬6mm‭)‬ which are all available off the shelf.‭ ‬It enables us to just plug-and-turn to lock the syringe on to the adapter.‭ ‬It will be good enough for the first extrusion‭ ‬trials but may need to be modified in the future for higher pressures.
