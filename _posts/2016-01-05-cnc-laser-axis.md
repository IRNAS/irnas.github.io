The build of CNC laser axis prototype is coming to an end. The laser axis is going to be mounted onto the frame of our GoodEnoughCNC mill. Both mill axis and laser axis are going to be mounted onto the same frame with Y axis construction, which will enable the use of both axis simultaneously on one frame.

Structural base for laser axis is aluminum rectangular profile of dimensions 100 x 50 mm with 3 mm thick wall. Guiding system is made out of two 12 mm linear guides, supported with 3D printed brackets. Trolley uses standard 608 zz bearings, which are double sided per linear guide. Trolley is driven by one Nema 23 stepper motor with T5 timing belt.

For testing we will be using 40W CO2 laser tube, which could be upgraded up to 130W..

With laser working dimensions the big problem is dealing with exhaustion of gases produced during cutting. We are designing smoke shield that would be effective, cheap and easy to built, with no need of expensive bending presses and other sheet metal forming tools.
