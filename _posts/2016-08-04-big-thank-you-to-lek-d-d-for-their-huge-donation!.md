Yesterday our [symbiolab](http://irnas.eu/symbiolab){:target="_blank"} was visiting the biopharmaceutical division of [Lek d.d. (Sandoz)](http://www.lek.si/sl/){:target="_blank"} where we acquired a used analytical scale but were also surprised by an enormous set of other equipment, which we were donated. A car full of stuff that includes a vortex, heating block, desiccator, Schott bottles, pipette tips and more has already been through the maintenance process and is now enhancing our biolab. Thank you so much!
