The new generation of Troublemaker 3D printer is operational for a few months now and in this time it has printed quite some parts for the [KORUZA 1.0 units](http://koruza.net/) and various other systems. The 3D printer performs well, and with its enlarged printing area the production of KORUZA parts is quicker and easier.

Some minor changes were made to improve the design. In this month we are planning to build a couple of Toublemakers more and test them together with our partners [Open Source Ecology](http://opensourceecology.org/).

One of the main goals for the Torublemakerâ€™s design was to be as flexible as possible. Its housing was primarily designed to be made with laser cutter, but we were testing some design changes so it could be made with CNC mill as well.

Stay tuned for more updates and the release of the design, source files and assembly instructions.
