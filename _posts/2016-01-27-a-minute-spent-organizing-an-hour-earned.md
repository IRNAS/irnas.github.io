In the beginning of this year we realized that we waste a lot of time walking around our office, storage room and workshops searching for tools and materials, which was driving everyone crazy. We were united in the decision that we need to take action and change this.

We started with a complete rearrangement of the storage room. We bought a new set of shelving system, which enables us to store things in a way you can immediately see what is sitting where. We organized our material and tools in the transparent boxes, putting a label on each. Boxes are arranged in seven sections: Network, Koruza, Electronics, Cabels, CNC + 3D printer, Projects and Tools, with a dedicated place in the shelving system for each. Now, everyone knows exactly where to look when searching for something.

The development part of our work is done in [KreatorLab](http://www.kreatorlab.si/){:target="_blank"} and in another small workshop. Since KreatorLab is also used as a public workshop we decided not to store our tools there and instead keep everything in the storage room, so that things don't get mixed up. And in a small workshop, where we have some additional machine tools we use at our work, we now keep only the tools that are used inthere.

Eva spiced the whole reorganizing and tidying things up with a small project - a special tool casing. She first took a photo of the tools, then she drew the design, printed it out on the paper just to make sure everything is on its place,  cut it out of the 5mm plywood on our [laser cutter](http://irnas.eu/irnas/2016/01/01/new-machine-in-the-house/){:target="_blank"} and glued it all together. Simple, functional and it looks great!

You might think being organized doesn't really matter, but we can already see a difference. Having things on its place reduces the stress in getting things done and it makes every single task faster and easier and the work flow smoother and more efficient. The one who said “Every minute spent organizing is an hour earned,” was definitely right.
