        <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-6 project"><h2>Troublemaker</h2><p>An open-source based on Ultimaker 3D printer design whose development was lead by a member of our team in Dru≈°tvo Elektronikov Slovenije. Assembly parts of the system can be universally found from multiple suppliers and thus anyone can replicate one without vendor lock-in. A uniquely fully enclosed design retains the heated air within the chamber reducing part warping with more demanding material. Enclosure design is fully stackable and yet still fits on a desk. We use a number of these printers daily.</p>
