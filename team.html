<strong>Boštjan Vihar</strong> is a Biomimmeticist with a PhD in Biology from RWTH Aachen University. He is interested in the structure and properties of living things and how these interact to create function. He believes that understanding the underlying principles of life and transferring them to new technology holds great potential for a more efficient and sustainable society.
As an undergraduate he focused on studying Animal Physiology and later Neurobiology and Bionics/biomimmetics. While doing research at the Institute for Cellular and Neurobionics in Aachen his interest shifted towards biological surfaces, their interaction with the environment and replication. In 2012, he began collaborating with the Graduate school for Bionics: Bonn - Aachen - Jűlich and in 2014 he was also active as a research assistant at the Institute for Biomedical Mechatronics, JKU Linz.
At IRNAS, he is building an open laboratory for biological and biomedical research, using low cost and DIY equipment, optimized for high-end research, with the goal of making it more accessible to the general public.
