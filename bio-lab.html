          <h2>What?</h2>
          <p>An open lab for biological research, composed of low cost and DIY components, yet capable of high-end research. First, yet hopefully not the last, open bio laboratory in Slovenia.

         <h2>How?</h2>
          <p>We use existing low cost and DIY tools to create a functional laboratory and we fill the existing gaps in low cost equipment by adding new tools to the open bioware repository and optimizing it for research purposes.</p>

          <p>Life and natural science with the focus on the fields we believe will shape our future, urban farming, biomaterials, combined with 3D printing and nanotechnology and sustainable development.

<h4>In sync with IRNAS institutes mission to bring scientific knowledge and new technologies to the public, we wish to add life sciences to our spectrum of investigation. Due to an overflow of information, there is a high discrepancy between basic research and applied projects for general use.
We wish to narrow this gap for a well-informed public, by making knowledge and resources available to everyone looking for information and wanting to participate in research.

            We obtained new facilities in Tkalka, which we will transform into two new laboratories over the next few months. First lab will be a general laboratory dedicated to biological an "wetchemical" research. It will be also used as a public space for everyone interested in doing research in life science. The second lab will be arranged for work under sterile conditions in a finely adjusted climate.

            In partnership with our colleagues from the London ZOO, we are working on a cheap, yet durable and reliable geo tracker for sea turtles. The current model is already being applied in practice, but we will try to improve it in the next months by modifying the surface to make it self cleanable and dry fast after getting out of the water, which will contribute to the rapid and stable connectivity with the nearest satelites.

            In our lab we plan to create a set-up, which will allow the study of mycorrhiza and ultimately symbiotic-mushroom cultivation. To actually grow fungi, we will require both, the stability of a solid medium, with the flexibility and control of a liquid medium. The advantages of both will be adopted, by creating a hybrid growth set-up, which will give the tissue the required support and also allow nutrient supply and exchange.Â  Different combinations of tissue inoculation and incubation with set-up architecture will be tested, to find the optimal conditions and to allow the study of the mycorrhiza. In the first steps, the fungal mycelium will be brought into contact with a plant partner, providing information about the relationship, which will be later used to emulate to appropriate conditions for fungal growth without the plant partner.
