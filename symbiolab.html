          <h2>What?</h2>
          <p>An open lab for biological research, composed of low cost and DIY components, yet capable of high-end research. First, and hopefully not the last, open bio laboratory in Slovenia.

         <h2>How?</h2>
          <p>We use existing low cost and DIY tools to create a functional laboratory. We fill the existing gaps in low cost equipment by adding new tools to the open bioware repository and optimizing it for research purposes.</p>

<h4>In sync with IRNAS institutes mission to bring scientific knowledge and new technologies to the public, we wish to add life sciences to our spectrum of investigation. We are facing a high discrepancy between basic and applied research today and we hope to narrow this gap by promoting citizen science and making knowledge and resources available to everyone looking for information and wanting to participate in research.

            We obtained new facilities in Tkalka, which we will transform into two new laboratories over the next few months. First lab will be a general laboratory dedicated to biological an "wetchemical" research. It will be also used as a public space for everyone interested in doing research in life science. The second lab will be arranged for work under sterile conditions in a finely adjusted climate.

            In partnership with our colleagues from the London ZOO we are working on a cheap, yet durable and reliable, geo tracker for sea turtles. The current model is already being applied in practice, but we will try to improve it in the next months by modifying the surface to make it self-cleanable and dry fast after getting out of the water, which will contribute to the rapid and stable connectivity with the nearest satellites.

            We are planning a set-up, which will allow us to study mycorrhiza and hopefully symbiotic-mushroom cultivation. To achieve this, we will adopt existing technologies and try to exploit and combine their different advantages, such as the stability of solid medium cultivation and the flexibility and control of hydroponics. In addition, we will test different methods of inoculation and incubation to determine the optimal conditions and maximize our chances of success.
